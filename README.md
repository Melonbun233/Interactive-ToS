# Interactive ToS - CPEN 541 Project

The aim of this project is to improve the likelihood of reading and understanding of terms of service (ToS) in software agreements prior to accepting them by introducing a new design approach focused on conveying “what we won’t do as a company” and “what you won’t do as a user” in the form of a detective game.  

The new form of the ToS will be based on multiple interactive games that reflect different sections of the user agreement. The games contain detective elements that require players to play as a judger and try to find correct evidence to support the claim of the user agreement violations.
